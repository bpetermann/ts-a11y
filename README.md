# Refa11y

**Refa11y** is a VS Code extension designed to help you improve the accessibility of your code. By providing refactoring suggestions, it guides you towards meeting accessibility standards, inspired by Manuel Matuzovic's excellent book, ["Web Accessibility Cookbook"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-accessibility-cookbook/9781098145590/)

## Features

Currently, refa11y focuses on HTML, offering warnings when your code lacks essential elements, tags, or attributes necessary for accessibility. Future updates will expand support to more (.jsx, .tsx) files.

## Installation

The extension is not yet available on the VS Code Marketplace, but you can install and use it locally by following these steps:
