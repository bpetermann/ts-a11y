Zugang is a VS Code extension designed to improve the accessibility of your HTML and React/TypeScript (.tsx) code. By providing warnings and suggestions, it helps you meet accessibility standards in a structured and intuitive way.

## Overview

Zugang currently offers warnings and hints when your HTML or .tsx code lacks essential elements, tags, or attributes necessary for proper accessibility. The extension focuses on common mistakes such as:

- Missing or incorrect accessibility-related attributes (e.g., `lang` on the `<html>` tag).
- Ignoring proper heading hierarchy (e.g., `h1 -> h2 -> h3`...).
- Omitting essential meta elements (e.g., viewport settings).
- Issues like "div soup," generic link texts, and more.

Each warning is accompanied by specific suggestions for improvement, helping you understand the issue and make the necessary corrections.

## Usage

After installing the extension, create an `.html` or `.tsx` file and focus on the file to see the annotations.

## Note

> The warnings provided are based on general best practices. However, in real-world scenarios, there may be valid reasons to deviate from these rules depending on the specific context. A general extension cannot always account for these variations. Additionally, the actual accessibility of a particular element is often influenced by the complex interplay of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Features

Support for `.tsx` and `.html` files will continue to expand, ensuring accessibility best practices are maintained across both standard HTML and React/TypeScript projects.
