# Zugang ![Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/bpetermann.zugang)

Zugang is a VS Code extension designed to help you improve the accessibility of your HTML code. By providing warnings and suggestions, it guides you towards meeting accessibility standards in a more structured and intuitive way. The extension draws inspiration from Manuel MatuzoviÄ‡'s excellent ["Web Accessibility Cookbook"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-accessibility-cookbook/9781098145590/).

## Overview of the Extension Features

Currently, Zugang offers warnings and hints when your HTML lacks essential elements, tags, or attributes that are necessary for proper accessibility. The extension focuses on common mistakes such as:

- Missing or incorrect accessibility-related attributes (e.g., `lang` on html, `aria-label` when multiple `nav` elements are present).
- Ignoring proper heading hierarchy (e.g., `h1 -> h2 -> h3`...).
- Omitting essential meta elements (e.g., viewport settings).

Each warning is accompanied by specific suggestions for improvement, helping you to understand the issue and make the necessary corrections.

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that the warnings displayed are general good practices, but in real-world scenarios, there are often valid reasons to deviate from these rules depending on the specific context, which a general extension cannot always take into account.

## Future Features

Expansion to support `.tsx` files, ensuring accessibility best practices are maintained in React/TypeScript projects as well.

## Installation

To install the extension:

1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code.
2. Search for `Zugang` in the marketplace.
